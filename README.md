* The major trends and innovation of this domain over the last 5 to 10 years are the following:

  > The domain managed to rollout blockchain-based to facilitate the movement of money across the borders partnering with financial institution.
 
  > Base on research, Blockchain innovation will allow the financial instution and investment banks to save up to $10 billion using blockchain technology.

## Ripple Results 

* Ripple has impacted the business by unlocking economic barriers. This is done by the use of digital assest and distributed ledger technology, to reach bank and unbanked population world wide.

* The core metrics are measured in this domain by the number of processed transaction, the speed which they processed and finalized. Peer to peer subsytem matric, which we can refer to as volume and traffic. [performace matrix](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-measure-blockchain-network-performance-key-metrics-en1234u4)

* Base on the performance metrix Ripples has the fastest payment processing time in the world at about 3 - 4 seconds per transaction, therefore we can say they are perform better than their competitors in this area.

## Recomendations

* My recommendation will be to expand and facilitate the payment processing system to the general public not just the banks and financial institution. 

* By doing this they can actually maximize their revenue because a lot of the individual population uses Western union or MoneyGram.

* They will have to use another form of identity validation system to guide against fraud.

* The identity validation system is what is current been use by other payment processing company in business. This is necessary because of the need to identify the receiver.
